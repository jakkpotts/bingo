# Stripe Integration Guide

## Overview

The card validation system now includes optional Stripe integration for enhanced payment processor validation. This feature uses Stripe's card validation API to verify card details beyond basic Luhn and BIN lookup validation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Stripe Publishable Key

1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Go to your Stripe Dashboard
3. Navigate to "Developers" â†’ "API Keys"
4. Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode or `pk_live_` for live mode)

### 2. Configure the Application

1. Open the card validation section in the application
2. Paste your Stripe publishable key in the "Stripe Publishable Key" field
3. The key will be used for all subsequent validations

## How It Works

### Current Implementation (Client-Side Only)

Due to Stripe's modern API requirements, this implementation provides:

1. **Format Validation**: Verifies card number format and length
2. **Brand Detection**: Identifies card brand (Visa, MasterCard, etc.)
3. **Basic Structure Check**: Ensures the card number follows valid patterns

**Note**: This is client-side validation only. For full Stripe validation (checking with actual payment networks), server-side integration is required.

### Limitations

- **No Network Validation**: Cannot verify if card is active/valid with issuing bank
- **No Fraud Checks**: No access to Stripe's fraud detection
- **Format Only**: Only validates card number structure and brand

### Enhanced Batch Full Validation

The application now includes a dedicated **Full Stripe Validation (Batch)** feature:

#### Features:
- **Persistent Elements**: Uses a single Stripe Elements instance for efficiency
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Combines Luhn, BIN lookup, and Stripe validation
- **Enhanced Checks**: Additional brand and length validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of validation failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during batch processing

#### How to Use:
1. **Enter Stripe Key**: The "Full Stripe Validation (Batch)" button appears
2. **Generate Cards**: Create your test card numbers
3. **Click Full Validation**: Dedicated button for comprehensive validation
4. **View Results**: Enhanced statistics including full validation metrics

#### Processing Details:
- **Initialization**: Sets up persistent Stripe Elements
- **Individual Processing**: Validates each card with multiple methods
- **Delay Management**: 750ms delays between validations to respect API limits
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of Stripe Elements after completion

### For Production Stripe Validation

For real-world payment validation, you would still need:

1. **Server-Side Setup**: Create Setup Intents on your backend
2. **Live Card Input**: Actual user input through Stripe Elements
3. **Webhook Handling**: Process Stripe webhooks for confirmation

The current implementation provides enhanced simulation suitable for testing and development.

## Validation Results

Stripe validation provides additional information:

- **Card Brand**: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.
- **Card Country**: Country where the card was issued
- **Card Funding**: Credit, debit, prepaid, or unknown
- **Last 4 Digits**: For verification purposes
- **Expiry Date**: When provided

## Error Handling

Common Stripe validation errors:

- `invalid_number`: Card number is invalid
- `invalid_expiry_month`: Invalid expiry month
- `invalid_expiry_year`: Invalid expiry year
- `invalid_cvc`: Invalid CVV/CVC code
- `card_declined`: Card was declined by issuer

## Security Notes

- **Publishable Key Only**: This integration only uses Stripe's publishable key, which is safe to expose in client-side code
- **No Secret Key**: Never enter your secret key in this application
- **Payment Method Creation**: Stripe creates payment method objects for validation, no sensitive data is stored
- **Test Mode**: Use test mode keys (`pk_test_`) for development and testing

## Testing

Use Stripe's test card numbers for testing:

- **4242424242424242**: Visa (successful)
- **4000000000000002**: Visa (declined)
- **5555555555554444**: Mastercard (successful)
- **378282246310005**: American Express (successful)

## API Limits

- Stripe has rate limits on their API
- For high-volume testing, consider implementing delays between requests
- Monitor your Stripe dashboard for usage statistics
